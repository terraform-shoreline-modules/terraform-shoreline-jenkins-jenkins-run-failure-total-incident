### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Jenkins run failure total incident
---

This incident type refers to a situation where there has been a total failure in running Jenkins jobs. Jenkins is a popular automation server used for building, testing, and deploying applications. When such an incident occurs, it can lead to significant downtime and issues in the software development and delivery process. The incident may be triggered by factors such as misconfiguration, code errors, or infrastructure issues. Resolving the issue promptly is critical to minimize the impact on the software development process.

### Parameters
```shell
export JENKINS_PORT="PLACEHOLDER"

export JENKINS_INSTANCE="PLACEHOLDER"

export JOB_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export BUILD_NUMBER="PLACEHOLDER"

export JENKINS_SERVER_ADDRESS="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### 1. Check the status of the Jenkins service
```shell
systemctl status jenkins
```

### 2. Check the logs for any errors or warnings
```shell
journalctl -u jenkins --no-pager --since "2 hours ago"
```

### 3. Verify the Jenkins configuration
```shell
sudo su - jenkins -c "java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war --check"
```

### 4. Check the connectivity to the Jenkins instance
```shell
nc -vz ${JENKINS_INSTANCE} ${JENKINS_PORT}
```

### 5. Check the Jenkins job configuration for any errors
```shell
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/${JOB_NAME}/config.xml
```

### 6. Check the Jenkins build history for any failed builds
```shell
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/${JOB_NAME}/builds/${BUILD_NUMBER}/log
```

### Infrastructure issues: When running Jenkins on an infrastructure that is not properly set up, there may be issues with resources such as memory, disk space, or network connectivity. This could result in failed jobs and ultimately a total failure of the system.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Check memory usage

memory=$(free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "%.2f%%", $3*100/$2}')

if (( $(echo "$memory > 80.00" |bc -l) )); then

    echo "WARNING: Memory usage is high. Current usage: $memory"

else

    echo "Memory usage is normal. Current usage: $memory"

fi



# Check disk space

disk=$(df -h / | awk '{print $5}' | tail -n 1 | cut -d'%' -f1)

if (( "$disk" > 80 )); then

    echo "WARNING: Disk space is low. Current usage: $disk%"

else

    echo "Disk space usage is normal. Current usage: $disk%"

fi



# Check network connectivity

ping -c 4 ${JENKINS_SERVER_ADDRESS} > /dev/null 2>&1

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

    echo "Jenkins server is reachable"

else

    echo "ERROR: Jenkins server is not reachable"

fi



# Check Jenkins log files for errors

if grep -q "ERROR" /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log; then

    echo "ERROR: Jenkins log files contain errors"

else

    echo "Jenkins log files do not contain errors"

fi


```

## Repair

### Restart the Jenkins server to see if the issue resolves itself.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Restart the Jenkins service

sudo systemctl restart jenkins



# Sleep for 10 seconds to make sure Jenkins service has restarted successfully

sleep 10



# Verify that the service has started successfully

sudo systemctl status jenkins


```
